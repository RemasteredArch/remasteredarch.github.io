# `remasteredarch.net`

The repository for my personal website.

Currently, it is very under development.
I will be starting with implementing `index.html`,
then a `projects.html` to show off various coding projects.
Lastly, a blog using a static site generator of some kind,
probably [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) because Rust.
